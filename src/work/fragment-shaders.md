For a few years I've been working on a long, slow project of learning glsl, particularly for writing shader code to use alongside ThreeJS. This is a collection of small experiments in fragment shaders. Some are literally just me practicing drawing basic shapes. Some are inspired by or riffs off of content from the famous [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/). Some are drafts that became a part of a live website or app later on. The site itself is built with Vue,with some hooks & helpers to make it easier for me to add in GUI tweaks.
