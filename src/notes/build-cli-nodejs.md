I recently created a little CLI for my own use to run an [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) command to transform a series of images into a video (I have some notes on that process here: [ffmpeg commands for image sequences](/notes/ffmpeg-gif-video)). Here are a few notes on the process of building a CLI with NodeJS!

## very basic setup:

1. Create an empty directory, `cd` into it, and `npm init` or `pnpm init`.
2. Create `index.js` in your new directory. At the top, add a shebang like this: `#! /usr/bin/env node`. This tells our shell which interpreter to use (in this case, NodeJS).
3. Add a **bin** entry to your `package.json`.

    ```json
    "bin": {
        "mycli": "index.js"
    },
    "type": "module"
    ```

    This sets your cli command as `mycli` and `index.js` as the file which will be run when you use that command. I also added **type** to use ES module syntax but that part is optional.

4. In the same directory, run this command to install your command globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g .
    ```

5. Add shebang at the top of `index.js` - this tells our shell which interpreter to use (in this case, NodeJS):

    ```bash
    #! /usr/bin/env node
    ```
